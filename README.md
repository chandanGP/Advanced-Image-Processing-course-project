* In this project we used two papers they are https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.08511.pdf and https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.10825.pdf
* This project is basically converting black and white images into colored images
* In Notebook AIP_project_colorization_by_zhang.ipynb we used there CNN model to colorize the images
* In Notebook AIp project paper 2 InstColorization.ipynb we used model by second paper to colorize the images
